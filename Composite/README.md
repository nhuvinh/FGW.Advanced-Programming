# Composite

Real world example

> Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has the same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

In plain words

> Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.
